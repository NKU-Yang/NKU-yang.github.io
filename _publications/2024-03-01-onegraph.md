## Abstract

We present **OneGraph**, a cross-architecture graph computing framework built on Intel's oneAPI that enables portable and efficient large-scale graph processing across different GPU architectures (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel). By abstracting away hardware-specific details through SYCL, OneGraph achieves near-native performance while maintaining code portability.

## Key Contributions

- A cross-architecture graph computing framework based on oneAPI/SYCL
- Portable graph processing across NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel GPUs
- Performance optimizations that achieve near-native efficiency on multiple GPU architectures
