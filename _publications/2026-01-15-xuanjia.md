## Abstract

We present **XuanJia**, a comprehensive virtualization-based code obfuscator that leverages virtual machine protection to safeguard binary programs against reverse engineering and tampering attacks. Our framework provides a multi-layered obfuscation pipeline that combines control flow flattening, opaque predicates, and custom virtual machine interpreters to significantly raise the bar for adversarial analysis.

## Key Contributions

- A comprehensive virtualization-based obfuscation framework for binary protection
- Novel virtual machine design with custom instruction set architecture
- Extensive evaluation demonstrating resilience against state-of-the-art deobfuscation techniques
