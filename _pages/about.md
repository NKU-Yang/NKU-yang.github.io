# üëã Hi, I'm **Shiyang Li(Êùé‰∏ñÈò≥)**

## üíº ABOUT ME
I'm currently a PhD student at UMN, school of CSE. I work with [Prof. Caiwen Ding](https://caiwending.github.io/web/home.html) and [Prof. Pen-Chung Yew](https://cse.umn.edu/cs/pen-chung-yew) on research in GPU programming, computer architecture, and computer system optimization. 

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Gong Xiaoli](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KZDQTBQAAAAJ&hl=en) during my B.S. and M.S. at Nankai University for 7 years, an incredible experience! 

## üîçRESEARCH

My research mainly focuses on computer architecture and GPU programming, especially about GPU memory management, high-efficienct CUDA kernels, and CPU-GPU heterogeneous computing. Recently I'm highly interested in LLM training/inference optimization on GPUs.
