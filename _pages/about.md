# Hi, I'm **Shiyang Li (李世阳)**

## About Me

I'm a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at the **University of Minnesota-Twin Cities**. I work with [Prof. Caiwen Ding](https://caiwending.github.io/web/home.html) and [Prof. Pen-Chung Yew](https://cse.umn.edu/cs/pen-chung-yew) on research in GPU programming, computer architecture, and agentic machine learning systems.

I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Gong Xiaoli](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KZDQTBQAAAAJ&hl=en) during my B.S. and M.S. at Nankai University, where I spent 7 wonderful years.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on **computer architecture** and **GPU programming**, with emphasis on:
- GPU memory management
- High-efficiency CUDA kernel design
- CPU-GPU heterogeneous computing

Recently, I have been working on **LLM training/inference optimization on GPUs**, **agentic MLSys**, and **agentic EDA frameworks**.

<span style="color:red;">**I'm looking for motivated undergraduate/graduate interns interested in coding agent design, CUDA programming, and agentic MLSys. If interested, please email me at li004074@umn.edu.**</span>
