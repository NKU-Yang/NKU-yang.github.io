I'm a PhD student at UMN, school of CSE. My research interests include GPU programming, computer architecture&system. 

I'm very fortunate to be advised by [Professor Caiwen Ding](https://caiwending.github.io/web/home.html). 
I was advised by Professor Gong Xiaoli during my master program at Nankai University.
